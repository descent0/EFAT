EFAT (Eco-Feasibility Assessment Tool) is an AI-powered system designed to evaluate the environmental sustainability and potential ecological impact of startup ideas. It analyzes both quantitative parameters and qualitative text descriptions of the project to determine its eco-safety score.

The system uses a Random Forest machine learning model for structured numerical data analysis, alongside a Hugging Face–based NLP text classification pipeline for understanding environmental intent and sustainability relevance in the project's written description.
